# Relaxed_selection_proj_reproducible_science
Cleaning up my master's project code so that other people can easily understand what's going on here.

This is where I'll combine all of my code so that my masters project results are easily accessible to my advisors. I hope to leave this project clean and concise, as I leave academia and move on to the next thing.

Apologies in advance. My code is a bit meandering. I learned how to code and use github while analyzing this data. My future data analysis will be cleaner and more methodical.


Bomb calorimetry and lipid analysis:
The "Bomb_notebook copy.Rmd" has the full female coho dataset
The "Bomb_notebook_subsetcoho copy.Rmd" has the subsetted female dataset.
-results reported in Table 4 are taken from line 268 for the energy results and line 287 for the lipid results, using one-sided Student's t tests.
---SD calculations in that same code block

We used the subsetted female dataaset for our primary results.
There's a few csv files associated with this one, mostly to add in covariates. In the future I will just use the raw csv files and do manipulation in R.
